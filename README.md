GRAR [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Knowledge-Players/grar.png?branch=grar-mvc)](https://travis-ci.org/Knowledge-Players/grar)
====

GRAR is a powerful framework to design training applications. The idea is to create an application without writing any code. We use a XML based language, as simple as possible, to allow users to create easily customizable e-learning modules. But if you're not afraid of getting your hands dirty, you can write your own plugins to modify the way GRAR works and generating a unique application, made specially for your needs.

We, [Knowledge-Players](http://www.knowledge-players.com), are waiting for your feedback!
